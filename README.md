# City Explorer API

**Author**: David Tusia

**Version**: 1.0.5

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This app is the API that will hold the back-end server used to retrieve the API's for the front-end requests. This helps hide the API keys. Data will we cached as well to help speed up future requests from the client side.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

**STEP 1:**
Git copy the file to your local machine if testing locally, link is here: [Back-End Server](https://github.com/dftjr/city-explorer-api.git)
(Heroku and Netlify are currently NOT working, please run code from localhost:3000

**STEP 2:**
Please have API keys ready in order to pull the informtion from the server. You can get the keys for free from the following links below:

[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

[Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)

[LocationIQ](https://my.locationiq.com/dashboard/login?ref=locationiq#demo)

**STEP 3:**
Git copy the front-end code, link is here: [Front-End App](https://github.com/dftjr/city-explorer.git)

**STEP 4:**
You should be good to go, Happy hacking!
